        Pramukh Swami Maharaj <mark  style="background-color: brown; color:rgb(241, 241, 245);" >(born Shantilal Patel; ordained Narayanswarupdas Swami; 7 December 1921 – 13 August 2016)</mark> was the guru and Pramukh, or president, of the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), a major branch of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, a Hindu denomination. BAPS regards him as the fifth spiritual successor of Swaminarayan, following Gunatitanand Swami, Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj, and Yogiji Maharaj. He was believed by his followers to be in constant communion with Swaminarayan, and ontologically, the manifestation of Akshar, the eternal abode of Swaminarayan

        Pramukh Swami Maharaj was Bhagwan Swaminarayan’s fifth spiritual successor. He led by example; his humility, faith in Bhagwan Swaminarayan, and compassion inspired millions of devotees and over 1000 sadhus to maintain moral and spiritual lifestyles. His was the simple life of a celibate, ignoring fame and recognition. His greatness lay in his ability to relate to the common man. He understood the problems people face in their everyday lives and empathized with their pain. His success is not measured by the awards he received nor by the recognition he accumulated. Rather, it is measured by the number of lives he transformed.

    <p class="swami"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-turn-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guru in the Hindu tradition is the gateway to moksha. He is the guiding light in the lives of his followers. They came to him for everything – spiritual enlightenment, moral development, and even worldly advice. And the guru."</p>

     <p id="swami"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-turn-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pramukh Swami Maharaj lent his ears to millions of individuals around the world and shared their sorrows. He gave them the courage to overcome personal battles. He comforted and advised on mundane issues, such as where to place a well in their field or where to set up manufacturing plant, and on significant matters, such as how to secure moksha. Pramukh Swami Maharaj steered the reins of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha for many decades, effectively administering its spiritual, cultural, personal development and humanitarian activities. </p>
